# An Attendance tool for the School of Business at USC

This serves as a taste of my work as a Data Intern at the school in Fall 2019. Read more below on how to run it!
My project: build an internal tool to automatically count student attendance at designated events by fetching from the 
Qualtrics API and handling the data. 

# Installation

If you do not have homebrew, go here: https://brew.sh

Once you have homebrew, if you do not have go installed then enter
	
	brew install go

into your desired directory.

Once this is installed, pick the directory you wish to store this project, then 
clone this repository!

Finally, do the following command within the std file you downloaded: 
        go build 

Then you are all set to run this repository!

The project comes with a built in configuration, but feel free to explore the CLI and change what you wish.

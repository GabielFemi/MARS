# An Attendance tool for the School of Business at USC

This serves as a taste of my work as a Data Intern at the school in Fall 2019. Read more below on how to run it!
My project: build an internal tool to automatically count student attendance at designated events by fetching from the 
Qualtrics API and handling the data. 

# Installation

Assuming you have a running version of Golang locally, fetch this project, build and run the binary!

The project comes with a built in configuration, but feel free to explore the CLI and change what you wish.
